# Thesuarus-Chrome-Extention
<----  Currently just messing around creating my first chrome extension!  ---->

Goal is to make an extention that will let users quickly query for words that have the same meaning, sound similar, or are spelled similarly on various web pages. 
## To build
* Navigate to 
```chrome://extensions```
* Then click 
```Load unpacked```
* Select the repo

## To use 
* Hylight a word that you want to query on
* Right click to open the chrome context menu
* Select one of the three queries 
* Query results can currently be seen in the consol but will be avalible via modal in the future
